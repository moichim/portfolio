					<p>In cooperation with Martina Horáková, we designed a history book.</p>
                    <p>In the research project, we found "jewish" students who attended our grammar school before the WWII. Some of them were Jews, others were labelled as such by the racial Norimberg Laws.</p>

					<Text>
						<p>The publication brings memories of people who knew those "Jews" before they were expelled from the school and deported. It also includes archive materials and broader historical context</p>
                        <p>The book was designed as a textbook about the Holocaust for grammar schools. It serves as such until today, being issued 3 times in Czech and 2 times in English.</p>
